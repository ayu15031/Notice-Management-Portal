# Notice-Management-Portal

Notice Management Portal is an easy solution for universities and institutions to send accept and receive notices. It can be used to access notices and other important information in a university. The main approach of the project is to get rid of all the paperwork and make everything online.  The project consists of an admin who accepts, rejects or edits notices. While the faculties and Club In charges can send notices to the students.
